   navigate('/booking', { 
     state: { 
       selectedService: service.id,
       serviceName: service.name
     } 
   });
   ```
   - Directly navigates to booking page
   - Pre-fills the selected service in the booking form
   - Service name is also passed for display

2. **For Guest Users (Not Logged In):**
   ```javascript
   navigate('/login', { 
     state: { 
       from: { pathname: '/booking' },
       selectedService: service.id
     } 
   });
   ```
   - Redirects to login page first
   - Maintains the selected service in state
   - After login, automatically redirects to booking with pre-filled service
